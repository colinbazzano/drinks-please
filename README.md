Cocktail recipes without all the nonsense

I am using the [Cocktail DB api](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to create a list of drinks that you can quickly view/search for and find the recipes. I wanted to make that a swift and easy process instead of scrolling endlessly through ads and backstories on someone's lives. Just the drinks and how to make them!

## This app was built using:

- React, via create-react-app which uses webpack and react testing library. Thanks Dan Abramov (and team)

- Tailwind CSS. Prior to this I had never really used Tailwind but heard good things about it, so I wanted to try it out!
